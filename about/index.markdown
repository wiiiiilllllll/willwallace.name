Hi, I'm Will. I'm a graphic designer and front-end web developer living in the South of England. I have nearly 10 years' experience in the world of creative design, including both print and web.

I'm equally at home using Adobe Creative Suite, or Sublime Text and Git. My background in print means I have a good eye for detail and a creative flair, while my coding experience gives me a solid understanding of the practicalities of making a design work.

Away from work I love listening to and making music; I play keyboard in two bands, [Lake Of Kings](https://www.facebook.com/lakeofkings) and [Buildings On Fire](https://www.facebook.com/BuildingsOnFire).

### About this site
This site is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and was designed and built to be as lightweight as possible. The code is mostly hand-crafted, with the exception of a couple of third-party scripts:

 - [bLazy](https://github.com/dinbror/blazy) (for lazy-loading images)
 - [uglipop](https://github.com/flouthoc/uglipop.js) (for the Lightbox-style image popups)

The typeface used throughout is [Work Sans](https://github.com/weiweihuanghuang/Work-Sans). The entire codebase for the site is open-source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wiiiiilllllll/willwallace.name).
