<p>Front-end development including CSS, JavaScript and PHP.</p>

<h2 id="the-work">The work</h2>
<p>St. James’s Place Insights is a magazine-style editorial site for financial advisers and their clients. I worked as part of the development team at Siteset Digital to build Insights from the ground up. When the Insights project began, St. James’s Place Wealth Management had been working with Siteset for nearly fifteen years and as such, we had plenty of knowledge of their existing web assets.</p>

<p>We worked from flat designs supplied by the client’s design team, Investus. This was an early foray into responsive design for Siteset, the client, and Investus all; as such we learned a lot about the difficulties of designing a single experience to fit multiple layouts. Many unexpected problems arose during development and I was often tasked with providing solutions.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges of the project was working with legacy code. Insights would need to inherit styles and behaviours from the large portfolio of sites we already administrated for St. James’s Place. As the only dedicated front-end developer on the team, my main concern was the CSS, which was in serious need of refactoring. Unfortunately that refactor wasn’t within the scope of this project, so we had to find an alternative; we ended up importing the legacy CSS wholesale and writing new styles to augment or override it as needed</p>
