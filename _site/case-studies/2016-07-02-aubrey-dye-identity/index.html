    <h2 id="the-brief">The brief</h2>
<p>Graphic design and website for Aubrey Dye-Welch, an independent hypnotherapist based in Bristol.</p>

<h2 id="the-work">The work</h2>
<p>Aubrey came to me in need of stationery and a website which would help her business stand out. With the practice already up and running, and a relatively tight budget to work with, my aim was to create a simple yet bold brand identity in a short amount of time .</p>

<p>During our initial discussion we agreed on a few key aspects of the brand: the logo should feature a sunrise; the main colour should be yellow; and the overall style should be clean, fresh, and modern. These aspects were designed to give the brand a sense of positivity and happiness, which is also what Aubrey aims to give her customers :)</p>

<p>With that in mind, I started sketching logo concepts, trying out various ways to represent a sunrise in a simple vector illustration. Once I’d settled on a handful of designs I paired them with Open Sans, a beautiful sans-serif font, to contribute to the clean, fresh style. I presented the designs to Aubrey, she requested a couple of iterations, and the logo was ready.</p>

<p>The printed items were quick to produce: I created business cards, headed paper, and an advertising poster. I also redesigned six evaluation forms, which Aubrey had originally designed herself using Microsoft Word. These needed to look presentable but also be easy to understand and use by the practice’s customers.</p>

<p>Finally, the website; Aubrey wanted a way to write blog posts and news updates on the site, so a CMS was needed. I looked at a few options but ended up using Wordpress due to its low price (free) simple admin interface. I would have liked the opportunity to build a custom theme for the site, but time constrains led me towards the simpler route of customising a (fully responsive) starter theme.</p>
