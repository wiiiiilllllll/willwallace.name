## The brief
A speculative redesign for City Financial's website.

## The work
This was part of a prospective redesign project for [City Financial][1], completed while I was at Siteset Digital. My task was to increase the visual impact of the home page, whilst retaining the existing content structure. Sadly the project never went ahead.
