Calibro Consultants are a newly-established firm of transport planners and civil engineers based in Bristol. I helped them build a bespoke website which showcases their knowledge and expertise to potential clients.

Before hiring me, Calibro had begun designing a site using a WYSIWYG site-building tool. They weren't satisifed with the quality of the design the tool provided, so they asked to take the basic concept and turn it into something more professional. In some situations this could have caused more work than simply starting from scratch; however the design proved to be a strong foundation to build upon. This neatly sidestepped the usual design/concept phase and sped up the project.

The site focusses on content, broken down into case studies and industry sectors to help prospective clients understand the business. The look of the site follows Calibro's brand; understated and minimal, using light greys and an accent colour of lime green. Subtle background videos add movement and visual interest.

We launched the site to coincide with the launch of Calibro as a business, but there's more in the works. Amongst other things we're currently discussing a blog/news section, which will allow Calibro to make new business announcements and improve their SEO.
