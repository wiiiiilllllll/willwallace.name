## The brief
Design and front-end development for the Harvest Moon Ball, a charity fund-raising event.

## The work
This was a fun micro-budget project, completed when I was part of the team at Siteset Digital. One of Siteset's existing clients, Germain Financial Associates, needed a new website for their annual charity event, the Harvest Moon Ball. My role was the visual design and front-end development.

The client requested that the site's look should be inspired by the Erin Morgenstern novel _[The Night Circus][1]_ â€“ a bold visual style with which I relished working. We created a simple brochure site with ticket booking facilities and CMS-controlled pages about the ball and its charity work.

I particularly enjoyed working on the home page, where I used SCSS maths to create a spinning, twinkling field of randomly-generated stars with a parallax effect.
