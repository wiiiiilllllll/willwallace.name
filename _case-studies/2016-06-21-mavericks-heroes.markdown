## The brief
Graphic design and brand identity for the Mavericks Brewing Company and their inaugural line of ales, the "Heroes" collection.

## The work
When Peter from Mavericks approached me about designing a range of beer labels I was very excited – this was a dream job for a real ale fan like myself! The Heroes drinks range is named after, and dedicated to, Britain's armed forces and Peter wanted this to be reflected in the design. He had an idea of the visual style he wanted me to pursue, drawing influences from art deco and early 20th-century Soviet propaganda posters.

I began by doing lots of research, soaking up the historical art which was to inform the look of the labels. The three beers in the Heroes range are Skirmish, Depth Charge, and Wooka Wooka (named after the slang term for a Chinook helicopter). A clear theme of "land, sea, and air" emerged as a neat way to differentiate each product while keeping them visually related. We'd also agreed to use a single colour for each design, which fit nicely with the propaganda theme.

I made some basic mockups of each label, to get a feel for our intended tone and atmosphere. Skirmish and Wooka Wooka came together quickly, but Depth Charge took a little longer. The explosive device which lends the beer its name is visually not very interesting, and I realised the illustration would have to focus on something else. After conferring with the client, I tried exploring some different options including submarines, explosions, and one composition heavily inspired by a famous art deco cruise poster. Eventually we landed on a design which worked.

With the mockups approved it was simply a case of polishing up the fine details on the illustrations, then adding the relevant blurb, legal, and informational text.
