## The brief
Graphic design and brand identity for Lipstick On Your Collar, a 1950s and '60s rock & roll stage show.

## The work
I've worked with Lipstick On Your Collar for several years; I designed their original logo and stationery. Since then we've worked on various promotional materials for both print and web.

Most recently, Adrian and Nikki from the band approached me to produce a poster design for their 2016 theatre tour. This tour was a step up both in terms of the size of the audiences they were playing to, and the effort and professionalism they'd put into the staging of the show - so they wanted a poster with real visual impact, to reflect that level of quality.

We began by discussing the desired style and tone, which was to be dramatic, bold, theatrical and colourful. Adrian and Nikki showed me similar posters they'd researched. We then chose some potential photos from the band's recent photoshoot at an authentic 1950s-styled diner. Using these I produced two mockups; one featuring the whole band, another focussing on lead singer Nikki. I presented the band with both mockups, and after exploring a few iterations we decided to proceed with the first option.

I took the chosen mockup and got to work. The design required significant Photoshop work to reposition the band members for a better composition. I also took this opportunity to create a 3d rendering of the band's logo, as we all felt the existing "flat" logo wouldn't fit well with the other elements of the poster. To finish I layered plenty of lens flares, bokeh and dramatic lighting effects onto a colourful "light burst" backdrop.

All that remained was to create different variants of the poster for each theatre on the tour, in sizes ranging from A5 up to 4-sheet.
