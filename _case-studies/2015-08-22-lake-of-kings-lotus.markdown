## The brief
Cover design &amp; artwork for the album _Lotus_ by Lake Of Kings.

## The work
As a professional graphic designer and amateur musician, designing my band's album cover is pretty much a dream job. We received some small praise for the bespoke fold-out cover I designed for our previous EP _Sparks_, and my bandmates were keen for a repeat success with our debut full-length album, _Lotus_.

When we sat down to discuss ideas for the artwork, the album title immediately suggested images of flowers and water. I remembered an idea I'd come up with a few years earlier, for a fold-out card sleeve which resembles a flower, its "petals" opening to reveal the disc inside. My bandmates loved the idea: as a prog-rock band we're drawn to outlandish and impractical ideas in our packaging just as much as in our music.

I went to [Squeegee & Ink][5] to screenprint the sleeves. I chose screenprinting for two reasons: our small budget and my high standards. For a short-run low-budget project such as this, digital print would seem to be ideal: it's low cost, economical for short print runs, and has excellent image quality. However I dislike its cheap glossiness, and persuaded my bandmates that our album deserved something more "authentic". I looked at other print methods including letterpress and Risograph, and even something much more lo-fi like rubber ink stamps. In the end I decided on screen print as the happy medium between affordable, authentic, and fast.

Squeegee & Ink were great; we experimented with inks and techniques, and they taught me how to pull the prints myself. The printed sheets were then laser-cut into the final flower shape. Laser cutting also enabled me to add small cutout windows to the design, where the CD shows through.
