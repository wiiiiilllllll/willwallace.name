## The brief
Design and front-end development for [Yoh][1], a recruitment agency with a focus on software developers and agile project management.

## The work
This is a project I worked on while I was part of the team at Siteset Digital. Yoh approached us at Siteset about redeveloping the website for their annual UK Agile Awards, as well as extending the site to include a magazine-style Agile Portal, which would act as a focal point for the agile community.

Yoh wanted a masonry-style homepage for the Portal, with a searchable and filterable wall of blocks representing the articles in their catalogue. The awards site was to be a more traditional brochure site, albeit with the ability to nominate and vote on the awards themselves.

As Yoh already had an existing brand identity, and the project deadline was rather tight, we skipped the formal Photoshop design stage and went straight from wireframes to design-in-build. I created fully responsive layouts for both halves of the site, and a consistent but flexible navigation to allow users to move from one half to the other. We also developed a fluid AJAX system for searching, filtering and loading the Portal's articles.
