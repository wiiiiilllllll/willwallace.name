## The brief
Design and development of a bespoke Wordpress theme for Distribution Technology, a financial software company.

## The work
This was a project with a very quick turnaround, completed while I was part of the team at Siteset Digital. Distribution Technology approached Siteset with a view to redeveloping the website for their main software product, Dynamic Planner.

The aims for the new site were: increased visual impact; implement the new brand style developed for Dynamic Planner; a Wordpess build for ease of use by the client. We decided the best way to get the site up and running quickly was to create a custom Wordpress theme, building on the [Naked starter theme][1]. My role as designer was to create wireframe layouts for the homepage and various content pages, which were then worked up into full Photoshop visual mockups. Once these were approved I also worked on front-end development of the site.

The homepage was a particular challenge, as the client had requested a high degree of flexibility: each section of the page would need be swappable, with several modules to choose from depending on the type of content to be displayed. We achieved this using the Advanced Custom Fields plugin. The plugin enabled us to create new sections of the CMS dashboard, allowing the client to manage their content while removing the possibility that they might break the site's HTML. UberMenu was used to create a fully editable dropdown navigation menu, while Gravity Forms was used to create custom permissions pop-ups.

This was the most in-depth Wordpress project I'd ever worked on, and showed me the possibilities of customising this popular CMS.
