## The brief
Visual design and front-end development for Siteset Digital, a digital design agency.

## The work
This is a project I worked on as part of the team at Siteset Digital. When the company decided to redesign their website, the entire staff got involved in the early planning and conceptual workshop. We broke off into small teams and discussed what we could improve on the existing site. Lots of high-concept ideas were thrown around, and at the end of the workshop each team created a low-fidelity mockup and presented it to the group.

It was my job to turn these ideas into a design proposal. Taking all the groups' mockups and notes, I tried to find a common thread between them. All the teams had expressed a desire for a more modern-looking site, with more colour and better use of white space. Circles were also a recurring theme, echoing the shape of the company logo. I had to discard some of the more fantastical concepts, but eventually things started to come together.

I began with pen & paper sketches, moving on to digital wireframes and eventually Photoshop. I discussed these mockups with the rest of the team, and their feedback enabled me to iterate and improve the designs. After a couple of rounds of iteration, we had a finished design, and myself and the other developers began coding. We used new front-end techniques such as CSS blend modes and SVG clipping paths to give the site extra visual impact.

This project marked my first experimentation with a living style guide; we began using [Hologram][1] to auto-generate style and markup documentation, mostly as a learning exercise.
