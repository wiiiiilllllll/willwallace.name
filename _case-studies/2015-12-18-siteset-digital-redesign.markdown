## The brief
Visual design and front-end development of Siteset Digital's website

## The work
This is a project I worked on as part of the team at Siteset Digital. Any good digital agency needs a website that will help sell their skills and abilities; Siteset Digital is no different. During 2015 we had worked hard to exceed our clients' expectations, and we were very proud of the projects we'd worked on, but our own website was looking a little neglected. The previous design had launched two years ago, which is an eternity in the world of web design. We needed a refresh.

The whole company staff got involved in the early planning and conceptual workshop. We broke off into small teams and discussed what we could improve on the existing site. Lots of high-concept ideas were thrown around, and at the end of the workshop each team created a low-fidelity mockup and presented it to the group.

Taking all the groups' mockups and notes, I tried to find a common thread between them. All the teams had expressed a desire for a more modern-looking site, with more colour and better use of white space. Circles were also a recurring theme, echoing the shape of the company logo. I had to discard some of the more fantastical concepts, but eventually things started to come together.

I began with pen & paper sketches, moving on to digital wireframes and eventually Photoshop. The main motif of the design a hyper-enlarged version of the company logo, containing the main navigation and header of each page. I went through a couple of iterations, presenting them to the team for feedback. Once the final design was approved, the whole team began coding, using new techniques such as CSS blend modes and SVG clipping paths to give the site extra visual impact.

This project marked my first exposure to CSS style guides; we began using [Hologram][1] to auto-generate style and markup documentation, mostly as a learning exercise.
