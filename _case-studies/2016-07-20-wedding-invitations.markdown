## The brief
Wedding invitations and stationery.

## The work
My sister-in-law Lynn and her fianc√©e Chris approached me to design the invitations for their wedding. After discussing their preferences for style and theme, they settled on a traditional, elegant, floral style. The venue for the wedding, Old Luxters Barn, is part of a brewery and winery that dates back to the 18th century, and Lynn and Chris were keen on incorporating this fact into the design.

We started with the save the date cards. These were designed to be printed as beermats, a format I'd not worked in before. I came up with several options, using a "grapes and hops" motif to represent the barn's history. Lynn (being a great client) liked one design in particular and approved it with almost no changes.

The rest of the wedding stationery set included the invitation, RSVP, and an information sheet. The design of these followed on from the save the dates, again using the grapes and hops illustrations and the blue & white colour scheme. Each set was assembled by hand and finished with ribbon and twine decorations.
