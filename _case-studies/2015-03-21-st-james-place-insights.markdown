## The brief
Front-end development for St. James's Place, a UK-based wealth management firm.

## The work
St. James's Place Insights is a magazine-style editorial site for financial advisers and their clients. I worked as part of the development team at Siteset Digital which built Insights.

We worked from static Photoshop designs supplied by the client's design team. Once we began coding, the responsive nature of the project presented many unforeseen challenges, and my colleagues and I were often tasked with providing workable solutions.

After Insights went live, we continued to develop new features for the site. These include a "save for later" reading list, archived articles, improved search & filters, and a feedback form. We also completed a visual refresh of the entire site, one year after launch. I'm particularly proud of my work on the CSS theme system: this allowed us to deliver several entirely separate colour schemes to various Insights instances, by simply changing a few Sass variables.
