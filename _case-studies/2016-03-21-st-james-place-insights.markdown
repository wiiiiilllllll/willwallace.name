## The brief
Front-end development including CSS, JavaScript and PHP. 

## The work
St. James's Place Insights is a magazine-style editorial site for financial advisers and their clients. I worked as part of the development team at Siteset Digital to build Insights from the ground up. When the Insights project began, St. James's Place Wealth Management had been working with Siteset for nearly fifteen years and as such, we had plenty of knowledge of their existing web assets.

We worked from static Photoshop designs supplied by the client's design team, Investis. Once we began coding, the responsive nature of the project presented many unforeseen challenges, and I and my colleagues were often tasked with providing workable solutions.

One of the biggest challenges of the project was working with legacy code. Insights would need to inherit styles and behaviours from the large portfolio of sites we already administered for St. James's Place. As the only dedicated front-end developer on the team, I was mainly concerned with the CSS; I worked to find a sensible system whereby new CSS could be written to augment or override the legacy styles.

After Insights went live, we continued to develop new features for the site. These included a "save for later" reading list, archived articles, improved search & filters, and a feedback form. We also completed a visual refresh of the entire site, one year after launch. I'm particularly proud of my work on the CSS theme system: this allowed us to deliver several entirely separate colour schemes to various Insights instances, by simply changing a few Sass variables.
